# Stitch parser — cheat sheet

Fast-lookup reference, built as we go. Assumes you've done the sessions.

## Front-end pipeline

```
source text → [lexer] → Tokens → [parser] → AST → [evaluator] → Value
```
- **Parser builds the AST; evaluator consumes it.** The AST is the contract between the two halves.

## S1 — Lexer

- **Maximal munch (longest match):** consume the longest valid token at each step → `->` is one token, not `-` then `>`. Owned by the *lexer*, not the parser, because whitespace is discarded — the parser couldn't reconstruct `->` vs `- >`.
- **Whitespace fully discarded**, no `Newline` token. Multi-line list literals work for free; no ASI continuation rules.
- **Int literals carry a parsed `i64`**, not text.
- **String interpolation is re-entrant:** lexer captures `{...}` contents as *raw text*; the front-end re-runs `parse(&raw)` on it to produce the inner `Expr`. Nesting (`"a {f("b {y}")}"`) recurses.

## S2 — The AST (`ast.rs`)

Four families:

| Family | Enum | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Declarations | `Item` | top-level **only** |
| Statements | `Stmt` | inside a block |
| Expressions | `Expr` | almost everywhere (incl. function bodies, const values) |
| Patterns | `Pattern` | left of `=>` in a match arm |

- **Expressions are the workhorse.** `Item::Func.body` and `Item::Const.value` are `Expr`. Only `Item` is file-scope-exclusive.
- **Conditionals & match are expressions**, not statements → usable in binding position: `x = (y > 5 => "big" | "small")`.

### Dispatch-relevant shapes (the bridge to S7)

- **No `MethodCall` node.** `obj.m()` parses as:
  ```rust
  Call { callee: Field { object: Var("obj"), name: "m" }, args: [] }
  ```
  Identical `Field` shape to a plain field read `obj.x`; *meaning* decided at eval time.
- `Expr::SelfRef` = the receiver `@`.
- `Item::On { target, contract: Option<Type>, methods }` — `on T {}` (inherent) vs `on T : C {}` (conformance).
- `Item::Contract { name, generics, methods }`.
- `Method { name, modifier, params, ret, body: Option<Expr> }`:
  - `body == None` → abstract **contract signature**. `Some` → concrete (`on`) or **default** (`contract`) method.
  - `MethodModifier`: `Instance` (immutable `@`) · `Mut` (may mutate `@`) · `Free` (no receiver — using `@` is a bug).

### Live gaps (what dispatch must fix)

- `interp.rs::register_items` has a trailing `_ => {}` that **silently drops `Item::On` / `Item::Contract`** — methods aren't collected at all yet. Step one.
- `eval_field` errors `"X has no field m"` — no method-lookup fallback exists.
- **S7 fork (open):** intercept `Call` when callee is a `Field` (before evaluating the callee) vs. invent a "bound method" `Value`.

## S3 — Pratt / precedence climbing (`parser.rs::parse_expr`)

**Idea:** one loop + one number per operator replaces the tower of `parse_or → parse_and → …` functions. Each operator has a **binding-power pair** `(l_bp, r_bp)`. Higher = binds tighter.

```rust
fn parse_expr(&mut self, min_bp: u8) -> Result<Expr, _> {
    let mut left = self.parse_prefix()?;          // first atom
    while let Some(op) = infix_op(self.peek()) {
        let (l_bp, r_bp) = binding_power(op);
        if l_bp < min_bp { break; }               // too weak → give operand back to caller
        self.bump();
        let right = self.parse_expr(r_bp)?;        // recurse with the right power
        left = Expr::Binary { op, left, right };
    }
    Ok(left)
}
```

Binding-power table (tightest at bottom):

| Op | `(l, r)` |
|---|---|
| `or` | (1, 2) |
| `and` | (3, 4) |
| `== != < <= > >=` | (5, 6) |
| `\|>` pipe | (7, 8) |
| `..` `..=` range | (9, 10) |
| `+ -` | (11, 12) |
| `* / %` | (13, 14) |

**The one inequality that matters:** next operator's `l_bp` vs the current frame's `min_bp` (which is the *enclosing* operator's `r_bp`). `l_bp < min_bp` → break (operand belongs to the looser outer context); else recurse (tighter op steals the operand).

**Associativity = pair asymmetry, not a grammar rule:**
- `(l, l+1)` (right > left, e.g. `+` = (11,12)) → **left-assoc**. `8-2-1` = `(8-2)-1`.
- `(l, l-1)` → **right-assoc**. (Lambdas get right-assoc *structurally* instead: body parsed with `parse_expr(0)`.)

**Non-associativity** (`a < b < c` rejected): the `(l,r)` numbers can't forbid chaining (they'd just left-associate). Extra check: `is_non_assoc(op)` (consults operator *identity*) **and** the next operator is same-level (`binding_power(next).0 == l_bp`). Parse-time guard standing in for the absent type checker (`a<b : Bool`, comparing it to `c` is the JS `false==0` footgun).

**Conditional `=>`** binds looser than every binary op → handled *outside* the loop, gated on `min_bp == 0`; branches parsed at `min_bp = 1` so nested `=>` must be parenthesised.

**Layering:** `parse_atom` (tightest) < `parse_prefix` (unary `-`/`not`, open-from ranges) < `parse_expr` (infix loop). Lambda lookahead (`at_lambda`) short-circuits at the top of `parse_expr`.

**Equivalent forms:** recursive Pratt ≡ explicit two-stack shunting-yard. recursion depth ↔ operator-stack height; `min_bp` param ↔ top-of-stack precedence; `break` ↔ stop-popping. Recursive = less bookkeeping + composes with recursive descent; explicit stack = when you can't recurse (overflow / VM).

## S4 — Lookahead & the tricky cases

**Lookahead vs backtracking:**
- **Lookahead** — peek N tokens to *choose a rule*, then parse it once, consuming forward. Never un-consume. Stitch is lookahead.
- **Backtracking** — speculatively parse, on failure *rewind the cursor* and try another rule. Can re-parse tokens. Stitch never does this.

**Three ambiguities, all resolved by lookahead:**

1. **lambda vs tuple** — `(a,b) -> …` vs `(a,b)`. `at_lambda` → `parens_then_arrow`: scan to the **matching** `)` (depth counter handles nested parens like `(x,(y,z)) -> …`), check if `->` follows. Iterates `self.tokens`, **never bumps `pos`** → pure lookahead. Cost = O(distance to matching paren), the price of never rewinding.

2. **placeholder → lambda** (`collect_placeholders` + `parse_arg`) — `$` desugars to a lambda **per call argument** (the boundary). Traversal **stops at `Expr::Lambda`** so an inner explicit lambda keeps its own `$`: `map(xs, x -> filter(x, $.ok))` → `$.ok` is filter's. Nesting works free because inner calls parse bottom-up and seal their `$` into a `Lambda` before the outer traversal arrives.
   - **Placeholder semantics = position-by-letter (rule #2):** the letter **is** the index (`$a`=0, `$b`=1…). Arity = highest letter referenced; **unreferenced lower slots → `_` holes**. So `$b` alone ⇒ `(_, $b) -> $b` — selects the 2nd arg. (`f($a + $c)` ⇒ `($a, _, $c) -> …`.) Cost: mnemonic names are out (`$x` = "arg 24"). Use `$a`/`$b`/`$c` contiguously. Impl: `positional_params(&BTreeSet<String>)` in `parser.rs`.

3. **guard `=>` collision** — `Some(x) if x > 0 => body`. Guard parsed at **`parse_expr(1)`**, not `(0)`. The inline conditional `cond => t | e` is only handled at `min_bp == 0` (bottom of `parse_expr`), so starting the guard at 1 structurally refuses to swallow the arm's `=>` separator. Same trick in subjectless-match arm conditions.

**`parse_postfix`** runs the postfix loop *above* `parse_atom`: `(` → call, `.` → `Field`, `?.` → `SafeField`, `?` → `Try`, `[` → `Index`. Left-to-right chaining, so `a.b().c` nests correctly.

## S5 — Declarations (`parser.rs::parse_item`)

`parse_item` dispatches on the leading token → an `Item`:

| Source | Item | Keyword? |
|---|---|---|
| `prod Name(fields)` | `Prod` | `prod` |
| `sum Name = v \| …` | `Sum` | `sum` |
| `contract Name { sigs }` | `Contract` | `contract` |
| `on Type { … }` / `on Type : C { … }` | `On` | `on` |
| `let name = v` | `Const` | `let` |
| `name(params) = body` | `Func` | **none** (`Ident`) |

- **Function has no keyword** → matched by `Token::Ident(_)`. Works because **top level is declarations-only** (no bare expressions — `Item` is file-scope-exclusive, S2). So `parse_func` *commits* on an ident: no lookahead/backtrack needed.

**`contract` vs `on` — same `parse_method`, one flag:**
- `parse_contract` → `parse_method(require_body=false)` → body optional.
- `parse_on` → `parse_method(require_body=true)` → body mandatory.
- `Method.body: Option<Expr>`: `None` = abstract contract signature; `Some` in a contract = **default method**; `Some` in an `on` = the implementation. Body-less method in an `on` = parse error (nothing to dispatch to).

**Two `Option`s — don't conflate (both dispatch-central):**
- `Item::On.contract: Option<Type>` — the `: C` **conformance** clause. `None` = inherent methods; `Some(C)` = declares the type conforms to contract C.
- `Method.body: Option<Expr>` — presence of an implementation.

### Runtime dispatch algorithm (the S7 target — derived in S5)

For `x.foo()`:
1. value `x` → its `type_name` (e.g. `Celsius`).
2. find all `On` items with `target == type_name`; scan their `methods` for name `foo` → found ⇒ run that `body`.
3. not found ⇒ collect the contracts named by those blocks' `contract: Some(C)` clauses (a type may have several `on` blocks); look for a **default** `foo` body there.
4. else ⇒ "no method `foo` on `Celsius`".

**Key architectural cut:** conformance checking (`: C` ⇒ does the type implement all of C? orphan/coherence) is a **static/compiler** concern. The dynamic tree-walker consults a `contract` **only** for default-method fallback (step 3) — otherwise contracts are ignored at eval time. Contracts out of scope = any the type never declared `: C` for (borrowing their defaults would be a coherence violation).

**Current gap:** `interp.rs::register_items` drops `Item::On`/`Item::Contract` (`_ => {}`); step 1 of S7 is collecting them into a method registry keyed by `type_name`.

## S6 — Patterns (`parser.rs::parse_pattern`)

**The capitalization rule** (`parse_pattern_atom`): an identifier is a `Pattern::Constructor` iff `starts_uppercase`; otherwise `Pattern::Binding`. Why: **parsing precedes any symbol table**, so the parser can't look up whether `Circle` is a real variant — capitalization is a context-free, backtrack-free signal. Load-bearing convention (no lowercase variants / uppercase bindings). Same as Haskell/Elm/Erlang.

`Pattern` nodes:

| Pattern | Source | Matches |
|---|---|---|
| `Int/Float/Bool/Str` | `3`, `"hi"` | that exact value |
| `Wildcard` | `_` | anything, **binds nothing** |
| `Binding(name)` | lowercase `x` | anything, binds to `x` |
| `Constructor{name, args}` | `Circle(r)` | the variant; recurse into args |
| `Tuple(pats)` | `(a, b)` | a tuple, destructured |
| `Or(alts)` | `a \| b` | any alternative |

- **Nesting = recursion:** `Constructor.args: Vec<Pattern>` parsed by `parse_pattern` per element → `Ok(Some(x))` = Constructor→Constructor→`Binding("x")`. No special handling.
- **Or-patterns one level up:** `parse_pattern` = atom, then `|`-collect into `Or` (outer wrapper). `parse_pattern_atom` never returns `Or`.
- **Tuple vs grouping** (mirrors S4): `(x)` → single element ⇒ returned **unwrapped** (grouping); `(x, y)` → `Tuple`. Signal = the comma (list length). `()` → empty `Tuple` (unit).
- `_` (Wildcard) vs `Binding("unused")`: `_` introduces **no** binding (can't be referenced; the canonical ignore-marker, = the placeholder hole from S4); a `Binding` binds even if unused.

**Parser tour complete (S1–S6).** Next, S7: implement the dispatch algorithm above.

## S7 — Contract dispatch, implemented (`interp.rs` + `env.rs`)

Basic `on X` method dispatch, end to end. (`on X : C` contract conformance / default methods deferred.)

**Registry** (`register_items`): `Item::On` accumulates into a `HashMap<String, Vec<Method>>` keyed by `type_name`:
```rust
dispatch.entry(name.clone()).or_default().extend(methods.iter().cloned());
```
`entry().or_default()` is the idiom for get-or-insert-then-mutate — never `get_mut` + `insert`. Multiple `on` blocks per type accumulate.

**Env bridge** (`env.rs`): the registry rides the same `Rc<OnceCell<…>>` machinery as `globals` (write-once, shared, letrec):
- field `methods: Rc<OnceCell<HashMap<String, Vec<Method>>>>`, cloned in `bind`, installed by `set_methods` (after `set_globals`).
- `lookup_method(type, name) -> Option<Method>` — two-key, hash by type then `.iter().find` by name, returns a clone.
- `globals_only()` — an env with the shared globals/methods/sink but `locals: None`. Method bodies run here so they see top-level defs but **not the caller's locals** (closure-hygiene applied to methods).

**Dispatch** (`eval`): `receiver.m(args)` has no method-call node — it's `Call { callee: Field }`. Intercept that shape *before* evaluating the callee:
```rust
Expr::Call { callee, args } => match callee.as_ref() {
    Expr::Field { object, name } => eval_method_call(object, name, args, env),
    _ => eval_call(&eval(callee, env)?, args, env),
}
```
`eval_method_call`: eval object → receiver; require `Value::Data` (else error — primitives have no methods); `lookup_method` (else "no method" error); arity-check; build `env.globals_only().extend("@", receiver)` + bind params; eval `method.body`.

**`@`** (`Expr::SelfRef`): the receiver is bound under reserved name `"@"`; the `SelfRef` arm is `env.lookup("@")`. `@field` = `Field { object: SelfRef, .. }`, so it flows through the existing `Field` arm for free.

**vs a Java vtable:** same goal (type-directed dispatch, implicit receiver), opposite end of the static/dynamic axis. Java resolves the name to a fixed **slot index** at compile time → O(1) array index, per-class table, needs static types + single-inheritance layout. Stitch resolves the name by **string lookup every call** (hash type → scan methods) → flexible, no types needed, slower. A vtable is the *optimization* Stitch could adopt once it has static types (the jlox→clox arc). Contracts, when added, are closer to Java *interfaces* (itables / hashed lookup) than class vtables — no single linear layout, which is exactly the multi-`on`-block shape.

**Contract default methods (`on X : C`) — done.** `register_items` collects `Item::Contract` (name → methods) and conformances (`on X : C` → type→[contracts]) into a `Registration` struct; `bake_contract_defaults` folds each contract's *default* methods (body `Some`) into conforming types, unless the type already defines that name (concrete wins; first contract wins on dup-name). Baking at registration = same semantics as a not-found-→-contract-default lookup fallback, but keeps `lookup_method` a flat lookup.
- **Late binding works for free:** a default body calling `@m()` re-enters `eval_method_call` with `@` still the concrete receiver → dispatches to the type's impl (open recursion / template-method pattern). The receiver carries its concrete type all the way down.
- **Decision — receiver never implicit:** sibling calls are `@m()`, never bare `m()` (bare = lexical/global only). One flat name-resolution rule; locked by `a_bare_sibling_call_does_not_resolve_to_a_method`. See design doc `## on`.
- **Not validated (deliberate, per S5 static/dynamic cut):** `on X : C` isn't checked to actually implement C's abstract methods — a missing one errors only when called.

**Method modifiers (`free`/`mut`) — done.** `eval_method_call` branches on the receiver: `Value::Data` = instance (binds `@`), `Value::Constructor` = the type itself (for `free`/associated methods, no `@`). The modifier must match how it was reached (`free` on the type, instance/`mut` on a value), else an error.
- **`free`** — `Type.method()`, resolved via the type's constructor value; no `@` bound.
- **`mut`** — binds `@` *mutably*, runs the body (which can `@field = …`), then **writes the mutated `@` back** to the caller's receiver place via `assign_place`. Value semantics: mutation isn't shared until the write-back reassigns the caller's binding. The receiver must be an assignable place (`is_assignable_place`) — a temporary (`Counter(0).bump()`) is rejected up front; an immutable binding is rejected at write-back.
- **Field assignment** (`obj.f = v`, `@f = v`): `assign_place` rebuilds the record with the field replaced and reassigns the *root* binding, recursing up a nested path (`a.b.x = v`). Records are immutable `Rc`s, so "mutate" = rebuild-then-reassign.
- **Bonus fix:** method bodies now catch `?`'s early-return at the method boundary (like closures) — a latent bug from the S7 dispatch.

**Per-field `mut` enforcement — done.** A field is assignable only if declared `mut` (`prod Account(owner, mut balance)` → only `balance`). A program-wide registry on `Env` (`field_mut`, same `Rc<OnceCell>` pattern as `methods`) maps variant name → field → `mut` flag, built in `register_items` from `prod`/`sum` field declarations (keyed by variant so sum variants are independent). `assign_place` queries `env.field_mutability(variant, field)`: `None` = no such field ("has no field"), `Some(false)` = immutable field error, `Some(true)` = proceed — so the one lookup does both existence and mutability. The binding-level `mut` check (`let mut`) still applies on top, at the root of the place path.
