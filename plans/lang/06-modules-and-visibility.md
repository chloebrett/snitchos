# Stitch — modules & visibility (iteration 1)

_The last thing between Stitch and an organised standard library. Turns the one
flat global namespace into many named modules, adds a `pub` boundary, and pins
where `contract` coherence lives. **This file scopes iteration 1 only** — the
decisions below are first-cut, not the final module system._

## Decisions for iteration 1 (locked)

1. **A module is a file.** Each `.st` file is one module; its name is the file
   stem (case-sensitive). `import seq` resolves to `seq.st`; the stdlib ships as
   built-in modules `Seq` / `List` / `Str` (PascalCase stems, so `Seq.map` reads
   right). **No in-file `module { }` blocks this iteration** — one file, one
   module.
2. **Stdlib namespaces are modules, not types.** `Seq` is a *module* holding free
   functions; `Seq.map(xs, f)` is a module-path access. The combinators stay
   plain functions, just grouped. Pipe is unaffected: `xs |> Seq.map(f)`.
3. **`import` brings names into scope.** `import Seq` binds the module; access its
   public members by path (`Seq.map`). `import Seq.{map, take}` binds the named
   public members unqualified. `use`/`uses` were unavailable (block-sugar and the
   capability row), so the keyword is **`import`**.
4. **`pub` is item-level only.** Top-level items (functions, `prod`/`sum`,
   `contract`, `const`) are **private by default**; `pub` exports them. A public
   type exposes its constructor and fields wholesale — **opaque types
   (field/constructor visibility) are deferred.** Mirrors the language's
   "exposure is the marked form" grain, the twin of `mut`.

## The testability seam — modules are a name→source map, not a directory

The kernel-core lesson carries over: the *core* is host-testable Rust; only the
edge touches the filesystem. So the loadable unit is a **module set** —
`HashMap<String, String>` (module name → source) — not a path on disk.

- `main.rs` / the CLI populates the set by reading `entry.st` + walking imports
  to sibling `.st` files in the entry directory, then hands the map to the runner.
- Tests populate the map **directly**, in-memory, no temp files. Every
  cross-module behaviour (path access, `pub` enforcement, coherence, cycles) is a
  pure `cargo test` with a literal `&[(name, src)]` fixture.
- Built-in stdlib modules (`Seq`/`List`/`Str`) are embedded source constants
  merged into the set before user modules, so they're always resolvable and the
  tests stay hermetic.

`run_program_source(src)` stays as the single-module convenience wrapper
(entry module named e.g. `main`, no imports) so the whole existing test corpus
is untouched.

## Resolution model — represent a module as a `Value`

The minimal-surgery insight: today closures already capture their defining
`Env`, and `.` is already field/method access. So:

- **Each module gets its own `Env`** whose globals = prelude + the module's own
  items + its imported names. A function defined in module A resolves its free
  names in A's namespace *for free* — closures already capture env.
- **A module is a first-class `Value::Module(name)`.** `import Seq` binds
  `Seq -> Value::Module("Seq")` into the importing module's globals. Then
  `Seq.map` is **field-access on a module value** — it reuses the existing `.`
  dispatch in `eval`: if the LHS evaluates to `Value::Module(m)`, look `map` up
  in module `m`'s *public* exports; else it's the existing field/method path.
  No new path-expression AST node, no new resolver — one new arm.
- **A module registry** maps name → that module's public exports
  (`HashMap<String, Value>`), built once during registration. Both path access
  (`Seq.map`) and select-import (`import Seq.{map}`) read it; both error on a
  private or missing member.

## Two-phase registration makes import cycles free

A genuine finding to surface (and the iteration's teaching beat): with **lazy
name resolution**, import cycles need *no* cycle-detection algorithm.

- **Phase 1 — declare.** For every module in the set, build its `Env` and
  register its own items (prelude + locals). No imports yet. (This is just the
  existing `register_items` per module.)
- **Phase 2 — link.** Now every module's exports exist, so process every
  module's `import`s: bind module values and copy select-imported names. A→B→A
  cycle resolves because by phase 2 both export tables are already populated.

So the only errors are **missing module** and **missing/private export** — not
"cyclic import." (Cycle detection would only be forced by *eager recursive
file-loading*; discovering the whole set first sidesteps it.) Document this as a
finding rather than building machinery we don't need.

## Coherence — where an `on` block may live

The orphan rule the design doc already gestures at, now enforceable because
"module" exists:

- `on Type { … }` (inherent methods) must live in **`Type`'s module**.
- `on Type : Contract { … }` (conformance) is allowed if **either `Type` or
  `Contract` is local** to the module (Rust's rule).
- Enforced at registration: error if neither is local. Dispatch itself is
  unchanged (still by runtime type name into the global method table) — this is
  purely a *write-site* rule that keeps behaviour findable with its type.

## Phasing (TDD increments, green between each)

1. **Module set + path access.** Runner accepts a module set; `Value::Module`;
   `M.member` resolves a public member of another module. Cross-module *call*
   works (`other.helper(x)`). Privacy not yet enforced (everything public) —
   smallest step that proves the namespace + resolution wiring.
2. **`pub` + privacy.** Parse `pub` on items; default-private. Path access and
   select-import of a private member error. The `pub`-less corpus still runs
   (single-module programs see their own privates).
3. **`import` forms.** `import M` (bind module) and `import M.{a, b}` (bind
   members). Missing module / missing export errors. Unqualified use of an
   imported name works in a pipe.
4. **Built-in stdlib modules.** Re-home the prelude combinators into embedded
   `Seq` / `List` / `Str` module sources; `Seq.map` etc. resolve. Keep the most
   common names auto-in-scope via the prelude so everyday code (`xs |> map(f)`)
   is unbroken. (Exact split of "auto-prelude vs must-import" is a sub-decision
   for this step.)
5. **Coherence check.** Reject an `on` block whose target and contract are both
   foreign to the module.

## Deferred (explicitly out of iteration 1)

- **In-file `module { }` blocks** (nested namespaces in one file).
- **Opaque types** — `pub` on fields/constructors/variants; a public type with a
  private constructor. The expressive encapsulation case.
- **Re-export / `pub import`**, import aliasing (`import Seq as S`), glob import.
- **Module-path *types*** (`other.Shape` in a type annotation) — types are still
  parse-and-ignore in v0, so cross-module type references need nothing yet.
- **Filesystem niceties**: nested directories / package roots / a manifest.
  Iteration 1 is flat: imports resolve to sibling `.st` files of the entry.
- **Visibility on `contract` members** beyond the contract's own `pub`.

## Why this matters

It's the gate on the organised stdlib (the `List.`/`Seq.`/`Str.` reorg from
[04](04-standard-library.md), now unblocked since lazy `Seq` exists), and it's
where encapsulation and `contract` coherence finally have a boundary to be
defined against. The `pub`-marks-exposure choice keeps the language's grain
("the deviation from the default is the marked form") consistent from `mut`
through `uses` to visibility.
