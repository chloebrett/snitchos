//! Kernel-side synchronous IPC endpoints (v0.9).
//!
//! The pure rendezvous state machine lives in [`kernel_core::ipc`]; this
//! module owns the *table* of endpoints, the in-flight message storage, and
//! wires `send`/`receive` to [`crate::sched`]'s `block_current`/`wake`.
//! Mirrors how [`crate::sched`] owns the task table over
//! `kernel_core::sched::Runqueue`.
//!
//! Lock discipline: every endpoint-state and `pending` access happens under
//! the `ENDPOINTS` lock; the *decision* (whom to wake, whether to block) is
//! computed under the lock and the lock is dropped before `block_current`/
//! `wake` run (never hold a `Mutex` across the switch — see CLAUDE.md). See
//! `plans/v0.9-ipc.md`.
